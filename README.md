# Big Data Bootcamp

During the Big Data Bootcamp, several modules are developed using Python (through Jupyter Notebook) and SQL as main languages. These resources cover a wide range of topics related to Big Data, including data analysis, machine learning, data science, EDAs, Python libraries, and more.

  - #### Week 1 - Introduction to Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics

  - #### Week 2 - Web Analytics

  - #### Week 3 - SQL (Data Management)

  - #### Week 4 - Python (Data Fundamentals)
    Regarding Python, we cover fundamental concepts such as data types, variables, and functions; then, we move on to more advanced topics such as data manipulation with NumPy and Pandas, machine learning with scikit-learn, and distributed computing with PySpark. We also explore different data visualization libraries, such as Matplotlib and Plotly.
   
  - #### Week 5 - Data Science and Machine Learning

  - #### Week 6 - Cloud Architecture and Big Data (PySpark)
    The notebooks developed in this module are created in [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com), so they need to be adapted to run in other environments.

In this repository, you will find all the code, different pages, and resources developed during the Big Data Bootcamp, organized by module and topic. I hope some of these resources help you gain a deeper understanding of Big Data concepts.
